Practical Foundation of Applied Systems Analysis - Data Repository

Welcome to the data repository for the Practical Foundation of Applied Systems Analysis. This repository is intended to supplement the book by providing readers with real-world datasets used throughout the course materials. The datasets span across various topics, including basic descriptive statistics, applied time series analysis, and systems analysis.

These datasets are here to help readers gain hands-on experience in research methods and analysis. They will help you implement practical techniques across many disciplines and establish a solid foundation for more advanced data science, statistics, and systems analysis skills.

The examples provided here, most of which are derived from real datasets, will enable you to apply systems analysis and predictive techniques to real-world scenarios. The repository is designed to cater to both beginners in statistics or data science and those with prior knowledge of these fields. The data can be processed and visualized in a variety of programming environments, though we highly recommend using Jupyter Notebooks (Python) or MATLAB for full accessibility.

This repository is self-paced. You can navigate through the datasets at your own convenience and in correlation with the sections of the book you are currently reading or studying. However, it is recommended to practice with these datasets as you progress through the book rather than leaving them all to the end.

We appreciate any feedback on the accuracy and relevancy of the datasets. If you have any suggestions or corrections, please feel free to email me at pcw8531@gmail.com (or pcw8531@snu.ac.kr). Your contribution will be acknowledged in the contributor list (unless you prefer to remain anonymous). Please include details such as dataset names and specific data points to help identify the issue more easily.

Thank you, and enjoy your journey through the world of applied systems analysis!
